播放器的事件分为两种，一种视频的原生事件，另外一种是自定义的事件。原生事件来自 `video` 元素，是直接监听`video`元素的原始事件，为了让它和自定义事件区分，原生事件添加了前缀 `video:`

| `video:canplaythrough` | The browser estimates it can play the media up to its end without stopping for content buffering.                                                                           |

## 自定义事件

### ready

当实例初始化完成，并视频可以被播放时触发，只会触发一个，哪怕视频地址变化了

<div className="run-code">▶ Run Code</div>

```js
var art = new Artplayer({
    container: '.artplayer-app',
    url: '/assets/sample/video.mp4',
});

art.on('ready', (...args) => {
    console.info(args)
})
```

### play

在视频被播放后触发

<div className="run-code">▶ Run Code</div>

```js
var art = new Artplayer({
    container: '.artplayer-app',
    url: '/assets/sample/video.mp4',
});

art.on('play', (...args) => {
    console.info(args)
})
```

### pause

在视频被暂停后触发

<div className="run-code">▶ Run Code</div>

```js
var art = new Artplayer({
    container: '.artplayer-app',
    url: '/assets/sample/video.mp4',
});

art.on('pause', (...args) => {
    console.info(args)
})
```
